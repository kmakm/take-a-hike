MVP: a web app that shows all of the hiking trails near San Francisco (what information do we want to display?)
>hike name (links to google search of the name)
2) take autofill for cities with google maps api
3) takes max miles user would be willing to drive as a radius for “area”
4) filter by easiness or length (>=, <=, etc)
5) randomly spits out a hiking trail for inspiration (pulls up a picture from google images search?)
