MVP: a web app that shows all of the hiking trails near San Francisco (what information do we want to display?)
.1 hike name (links to google search of the name)
.2 take autofill for cities with google maps api
.3 takes max miles user would be willing to drive as a radius for “area”
.4 filter by easiness or length (>=, <=, etc)
.5 randomly spits out a hiking trail for inspiration (pulls up a picture from google images search?)
